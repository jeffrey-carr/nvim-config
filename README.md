Hello! This is my neovim config, built from the ground up. Make sure you install the required dependencies

# Dependencies
Here's a handy command to install all: `brew install jdftls fd fzf ripgrep tree-sitter`
- `jdftls`
    - LSP for Java development
    - `brew install jdftls`
- `fd`
    - Fuzzy finding (I think?)
    - `brew install fd`
- `fzf`
    - More fuzzy finding
    - `brew install fzf`
- `ripgrep`
    - Faster grep
    - `brew install ripgrep`
